This paper presents a viscoelastic-aware lung model developed within the XPBD framework, which is integrated into a high-fidelity training platform based on mixed reality , providing real-time haptic feedback and four thoracoscopic skill modules, aiming to detect hand-eye coordination, bilateral role assignment, and depth control. Fifteen trainees were invited to participate in the training to evaluate the effectiveness of the structure and the training effect.we designed four foundational training modules: tiny object transfer, vascular occlusion and cutting, rope perforation, and lung cutting. 
To facilitate uninterrupted training, all participants had to become acquainted with the protocols and scoring rubric of all four modules prior to the official experiments. All experiments complied with ethical requirements, and informed consent was obtained from the trainees before any public release of experimental data.
